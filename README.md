Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room, a game development company with a successful Android-based game application. They wanted us to help them transition their game to other platforms since their current team wasn't confident in their abilities to do so. They wanted the game to be web-based and be capable of running on multiple common operating platforms i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux, and other mobile devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

While developing this documentation I thought that I did a good job collecting as much relevant information as possible; then I presented the client with a well-defined view of the project and eloquent recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through a design document while developing the code helped me provide the most value to the client by staying organized and aligned with the project requirements and goal.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to revise one part of the design document, I think it would be with the evaluation section. The reason I select this section is that I believe it would be more helpful for the client if I would have provided more quantitative data with regards to costs and metrics i.e. licensing costs and server capacity. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I think most of my user-focused considerations went into my recommendations section of the design document. The rest of the document is designed to be more focused on informing the client of potential options and plans. The recommendations helps to explain why I believe the Windows operating platform to be the best choice, and part of that reasoning is how it impacts the end-user. Decisions like server potential, security, and memory management all directly affect the end-user and their experice with the game. The reason it is important to consider the user's needs when designing is because the application is completely user driven. In order for the application to be succesful, it has to be accessible, engaging, and provide satisfaction for the user. If the design process does not take these things into consideration, then the end product can potentially fail in these areas and result in an unsuccesful product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach that I took to design this software was more of a Waterfall methodology that utilized a client-server design pattern and a RESTful API. Techniques and strategies that I would use in a future development of a similar application would be to try and implement more of an Agile approach that increases the client involvement in order to ensure that the development process is providing the most value at each step of the project. I would also try to implement more a Test-Driven Development process in order to ensure that the code we are developing is satisfying all of the requirements and catching any bugs as we develop in order to produce a cleaner end product.
